# OpenVPN assigns a /30 subnet to each client. Instead if listing the exact IP address that the is assign, the ipp file saves the network address (the first IP number in a /30 subnet).
# In tap mode there are no /30 subnets used so the ipp file will then contain the accual IP address assigned to each client.
