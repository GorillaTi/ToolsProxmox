# CREATE CLUSTER
pvecm create YOUR-CLUSTER-NAME
pvecm status

# ADD NODE
pvecm add IP-ADDRESS

# REMOVE NODE
# It is very important to power off the node before removal, and make sure that it will not power on again (in the network) as it is. 
# Move all virtual machines from the node, just use the Central Web-based Management to migrate or delete all VMÂ´s. Make sure you have no local backups you want to keep, or save them accordingly.
#Log in to one remaining node via ssh. Issue a pvecm nodes command to identify the nodeID: 

pvecm status
# power down the node 
pvecm nodes

# then delete it
pvecm delnode IP-ADDRESS
