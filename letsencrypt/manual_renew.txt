Alle volte lo script di aggiornamento auto o semi-auto torna errore, apparentemente inspiegabile.

Per eludere ogni automatismo farlocco, in caso di proptrarsi di questa eccezione (anche se verificata lato DNS e lato webserver...)

========================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - The following errors were reported by the server:

   Domain: dfds.cladfsdf.dominio.it
   Type:   connection
   Detail: Could not connect to th host

   To fix these errors, please make sure that your domain name was
   entered correctly and the DNS A record(s) for that domain
   contain(s) the right IP address. Additionally, please check that
   your computer has a publicly routable IP address and that no
   firewalls are preventing the server from communicating with the
   client. If you're using the webroot plugin, you should also verify
   that you are serving files from the webroot path you provided.

# E' bene configurare un directory serve manuale a livello di webserver, in caso di nginx:

    location /.well-known/acme-challenge
  {
        alias /path/webroot/media/letsencrypt/.well-known/acme-challenge;
        autoindex off;
    }

service nginx reload
# creare la path
mkdir -p media/letsencrypt/.well-known/acme-challenge
# verificare che questa sia raggiungibile dall'esterno con un file di esempio

# eppoi:
/opt/letsencrypt/letsencrypt-auto certonly --manual

If you don't have HTTP server configured, you can run the following
command on the target server (as root):

mkdir -p /tmp/certbot/public_html/.well-known/acme-challenge
cd /tmp/certbot/public_html
printf "%s" XxX > .well-known/acme-challenge/wNzL01Fcuy4cwfs8pduJ1XoMqj8XoCDUoU-4sHGgTno
