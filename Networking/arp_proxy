proxy_arp - BOOLEAN
	Do proxy arp.
	proxy_arp for the interface will be enabled if at least one of
	conf/{all,interface}/proxy_arp is set to TRUE,
	it will be disabled otherwise

proxy_arp_pvlan - BOOLEAN
	Private VLAN proxy arp.
	Basically allow proxy arp replies back to the same interface
	(from which the ARP request/solicitation was received).

	This is done to support (ethernet) switch features, like RFC
	3069, where the individual ports are NOT allowed to
	communicate with each other, but they are allowed to talk to
	the upstream router.  As described in RFC 3069, it is possible
	to allow these hosts to communicate through the upstream
	router by proxy_arp'ing. Don't need to be used together with
	proxy_arp.

	This technology is known by different names:
	  In RFC 3069 it is called VLAN Aggregation.
	  Cisco and Allied Telesyn call it Private VLAN.
	  Hewlett-Packard call it Source-Port filtering or port-isolation.
	  Ericsson call it MAC-Forced Forwarding (RFC Draft).

# The proper invocation to provide proxy ARP for fnord is given below; of course, the Ethernet address given must be that of gate.
arp -s fnord 00:00:c0:a1:42:e0 pub
 
# The proxy ARP entry may be removed again by invoking:
arp -d fnord
